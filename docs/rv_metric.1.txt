RV_METRIC(1)
============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
rv_metric - load and plot data from a GPS running watch


SYNOPSIS
--------
*rv_metric*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The rv_imperial(1) command starts a graphical user interface to load
and plot information from a universal serial bus (USB) connected Global
Positioning System (GPS) watch.  
The rv_metric(1) command was developed primarily with runners in mind
but portions of it may also be useful for cyclists. In order to be
compatible with this program, the GPS watch 
must store its information internally via the Flexible and Interoperable 
Data Transfer (or FIT) protocol.  No other protocol is currently supported.
Information displayed
can include latitude, longitude, pace, heartrate, and more.  The command
can also manipulate files previously copied from the watch into a file folder.

The rv_metric(1) command displays information in the metric unit system 
(distances are in kilometers, pace is in min/km, etc.).  A companion command,
rv_imperial, is also available for viewing the same information in the imperial
unit system (distances are in miles, pace is in min/mile, etc.).

Immediately upon execution, the command will prompt the user for the location
 of the data file. If you are executing the command under Windows, the command 
 will first
 attempt to locate where the watch has been plugged in via USB and 
 open the directory containing the FIT files.
 After loading the file into memory, the graphical plotting widget 
supports a click and drag zoom feature for closer inspection.  In
addition, individual data point values can be displayed by hovering the
mouse pointer over the plotted points.  
If an internet connection is available, the command will also display a graphic 
of an activity's GPS track.  Otherwise no track will be displayed.
Loading additional FIT files individually
is supported on the graphical interface without the need to restart the program.
